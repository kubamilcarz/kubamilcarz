# Hi, I’m Kuba 👋

*🎯 iOS Developer / Flutter / 🖥️ Building apps for iOS, visionOS, and macOS*

I’m an independent iOS developer passionate about creating meaningful apps that enrich daily life. Currently, I have 6 apps live on the App Store, including:
  - Memorize - A flashcards learning app.
  - [Bookie](https://getbookie.app) - A reading tracker for book lovers.
  - Coffee Note - A journal for coffee tasting.
  - Escape - A travel journal to keep your memories alive.
  - Palace - A math game to memorize pi digits (open-source).
  - Reflect - A weekly review journal.

I specialize in Swift and SwiftUI, and I’m currently expanding my skillset with Flutter and Kotlin Multiplatform to explore cross-platform development. I care about thoughtful design, smooth UX, and building tools people love using every day.

### Open Source
Check out pinned repos, which include open source projects (one of which is available on the App Store) and SwiftUI packages I use on daily basis.
